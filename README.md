# âš¡ EV Sales Analysis using Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project analyzes **Electric Vehicle (EV) sales data** to identify market trends, growth patterns, and regional adoption rates.
Using **Python for data analysis and visualization**, the project uncovers key insights into EV adoption, top-selling models, and sales performance across regions and time periods.
The goal is to support **business strategy, market planning, and policy decision-making** in the growing EV industry.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Clean and preprocess raw EV sales data for analysis.
* Identify **top-selling EV models** and manufacturers.
* Analyze **yearly and monthly sales growth** trends.
* Compare **regional adoption rates** and market penetration.
* Visualize EV sales insights through interactive and static plots.

## ðŸš€ Workflow

1. **Data Import** â€“ Load dataset into Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Summarize data statistics and identify trends.
4. **Visualization** â€“ Use Matplotlib/Seaborn to create:

   * Yearly sales growth charts
   * Top-selling EV models
   * Manufacturer market share pie charts
   * Regional sales heatmaps
5. **Insights & Recommendations** â€“ Document findings for decision-making.
